## Workflow `output {}` blocks

No top-level `output {}` block found. See the docs for how to add one:

## Legacy `publishDir` references

Found 3 `publishDir` references across 1 file that should be migrated to the workflow `output {}` block:

- [`conf/modules.config`](https://github.com/nf-core/phyloplace/blob/6bb080cdd04fe17c9800cf06b8de4ca926c77b4c/conf/modules.config#L15) — 3 references
